# BRB-Portfolio-Project-
This is the repo for my class portfolio project and I have called it Brett Russell Bates' Portfolio Project. I started this portfolio for class in the hopes that through the duration of the class I will add what I learn and what I create to the portfolio to land a job as a web developer. I used the languages of HTML and CSS to start building my portfolio. The HTML gives it the structure needed and the CSS gives it the desired style and look that I was longing for. 

This application allows someone to easily visit and navigate through the application to read a little about me, see projects I have worked on and it also gives them a way to contact me. Here, give it a try!  Click this link to view my portfolio! https://brbates86.github.io/BRB-Portfolio-Project-/

As I created my very first portfolio I learned that there are many different ways to complete this project! I really enjoyed the task of creating and running the application. If it didn't work I figured out why and fixed it!
