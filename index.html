                <p> My career started as a carpenter, learning from my dad right out of high school.
                    Over the years my specialty became rough carpentry or creating the skeleton of a building.
                As an experienced carpenter and maintenance professional, I mastered a variety of tasks over the years, which has sharpened my ability to learn and improve processes, and team up successfully with a variety of personalities. 


                As my family grew so did my ambition to develop and provide. In the spirit of challenging myself mentally and professionally, I decided to take my rough carpentry skills online. My goal is to now create the skeletons of websites with HTML, building them out with CSS/JS. Today, I am a student working to become a full-stack developer. I am looking to join a company that encourages new ideas, learning and career growth.</p>  

                

                <p>Currently I lead the worship team at church where I am reponsible for organizing service structure and leading 
                    the congregation in songs. This is where I can exercise my passion for singing and playing guitar. Often my weekends are spent watching the Chiefs and exploring downtown Kansas City with my wife.
